### SANDBOX_DATABASE_FIX.md - Database Timing and Coordination Fix
**Date**: 2025-10-11

**Problem Solved**:
- **Error**: `Failed to get database secret: Error: No database cluster found for project`
- **Symptoms**: Sandbox creation failing due to database credentials not found
- **Impact**: Users unable to create new sandboxes

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Timing Issue**: `createSandbox()` attempted to fetch credentials before database was ready
2. **Naming Mismatch**: Credential lookup logic didn't match new naming pattern `{project}-agentruntime-{suffix}`
3. **Race Condition**: KubeBlocks secret creation takes time, causing immediate lookups to fail

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Added `waitForDatabaseReady()` method**:
   - Polls KubeBlocks cluster status until "Running" state
   - Verifies connection credentials secret exists
   - 2-minute timeout with 3-second polling interval
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

2. **Enhanced `createPostgreSQLDatabase()` method**:
   - Waits for database cluster readiness before returning
   - Returns actual credentials from KubeBlocks secret
   - Falls back to defaults if credentials unavailable
   - Added detailed logging

3. **Improved `createSandbox()` method**:
   - Added optional `databaseInfo` parameter
   - Accepts pre-created database credentials directly
   - Falls back to lookup for existing projects
   - Continues with defaults if lookup fails

4. **Fixed API Route** (`/app/api/sandbox/[projectId]/route.ts`):
   - Passes database credentials from creation to deployment
   - Eliminates race condition between operations
   - Maintains backward compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `/lib/kubernetes.ts` - Core orchestration logic
- `/app/api/sandbox/[projectId]/route.ts` - API endpoint

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ Database cluster created and ready
- ‚úÖ Sandbox created successfully with credentials
- ‚úÖ All 5 test scenarios pass
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained

**Performance Impact**:
- Database Creation: +2 minutes max (waiting for readiness)
- Sandbox Creation: Faster (no credential lookup delays)
- Overall: Better user experience with progress indication

**Audience**: Developers debugging database issues, reviewers of the fix

## üéØ Purpose of This Directory

The `fixes/` directory serves as the **bug fix knowledge base** for FullstackAgent. These documents:

1. **Document Problems**: Detailed description of issues encountered
2. **Explain Root Causes**: Deep analysis of why problems occurred
3. **Record Solutions**: How problems were solved, not just what was changed
4. **Verify Results**: Test results proving the fix works
5. **Preserve Knowledge**: Prevent similar issues in the future
