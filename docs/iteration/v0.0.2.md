# v0.0.2 Version Optimization List

## Project Main Page Optimization

* Make the layout more compact, add a vertical navigation bar on the left, but be careful not to make it too wide. It can be like VSCode layout, with Project list and create new Project both placed on the left side. This is first-level navigation.
* The second column on the left is second-level navigation, which can be wider but supports collapse functionality. Display items in a flat layout: Environment Variables/Secret Configuration/Auth Configuration/Payment Configuration/Deployment/Link GitHub Repository. These options are all at the same level.
    * When opening environment variables and secrets, please display important environment variable information, such as database connection information, Claude Code related configuration environment variables
* The entire main interface should focus on the web terminal, so the majority of the page should be terminal
* Support multiple terminals, like opening multiple files in VSCode, implemented in the top navigation bar, be careful not to make it too wide. Add a Network button and operation buttons to the far right of the top.
    * The Network button supports viewing all externally accessible domains and mapped ports of the sandbox, and can also have the function to add domains and ports
    * Operation buttons include: Start/Stop/Restart/Delete

## Project List Optimization

* The status display area can look better, for example, add a green dot for Ready status, red for stopped, yellow for other states.

## Terminal Path Display Optimization

* `root@aaa-agentruntime-w43o9o-6d57cbbd76-n4lqf:/workspace/test/project#` this path is too long
    * Shorten the naming rule to [project-name]-agent-[6-digit]
    * Don't display absolute path, only show relative path
    * Optimized terminal path example: `root@aaa-agent-w43o9o:project#`

## Overall Style

The overall style is not clean enough, could be optimized.
