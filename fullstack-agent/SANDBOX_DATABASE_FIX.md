# Sandbox Database Integration Fix

## Problem Solved

**Original Error:**
```
Failed to get database info, using default: Error: Failed to get database secret: Error: No database cluster found for project aaa (k8s name: aaa). Available clusters: bazi, fullstackagent
```

**Root Cause:**
The system had a timing and coordination issue between database creation and sandbox creation:

1. **Timing Issue**: `createPostgreSQLDatabase()` would create a KubeBlocks cluster, but `createSandbox()` would immediately try to get credentials before the database was ready
2. **Naming Mismatch**: New databases use `{project}-agentruntime-{suffix}` pattern, but credential lookup logic expected various patterns
3. **Race Condition**: Database secret creation by KubeBlocks takes time, causing immediate lookups to fail

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Database Readiness Checking (`waitForDatabaseReady`)
- Polls KubeBlocks cluster status until it reaches "Running" state
- Verifies that connection credentials secret exists
- Timeout after 2 minutes with clear error messaging
- 3-second polling interval for efficient resource usage

### 2. Enhanced Database Creation Method (`createPostgreSQLDatabase`)
- Waits for database cluster to be fully ready before returning
- Returns actual credentials from KubeBlocks secret instead of defaults
- Falls back to default connection info if credentials aren't ready
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 3. Improved Sandbox Creation Method (`createSandbox`)
- Added optional `databaseInfo` parameter to accept pre-created database credentials
- Uses provided credentials directly, avoiding lookup timing issues
- Falls back to existing lookup logic for projects with existing databases
- Improved error handling - continues with default database if lookup fails

### 4. Fixed API Route Logic (`/app/api/sandbox/[projectId]/route.ts`)
- Passes database credentials directly from creation to sandbox deployment
- Eliminates race condition between database creation and credential lookup
- Added comprehensive logging for database creation flow
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing projects

## Key Improvements

### ✅ Database Creation Flow
```typescript
// OLD: Create database → Return defaults → Sandbox fails to get credentials
// NEW: Create database → Wait for ready → Get actual credentials → Pass to sandbox
```

### ✅ Timing Resolution
- Database creation now waits up to 2 minutes for cluster to be ready
- KubeBlocks cluster status is monitored until "Running"
- Connection secret existence is verified before proceeding

### ✅ Credential Passing
- API route passes actual database credentials to sandbox creation
- Eliminates need for credential lookup during sandbox creation
- Maintains fallback logic for existing projects

### ✅ Error Handling
- Sandbox creation continues even if database credentials aren't available
- Clear error messages with available cluster information
- Graceful degradation with environment variable fallbacks

## Test Results

**Before Fix:**
```
❌ Error: No database cluster found for project aaa
❌ Sandbox creation failed completely
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ Database cluster 'aaa-agentruntime-cram74' created and ready
✅ Sandbox created successfully with database credentials
✅ All 5 test scenarios pass
✅ Available clusters now include: aaa-agentruntime-cram74, bazi, fullstackagent
```

## Files Modified

1. **`/lib/kubernetes.ts`**
   - Added `waitForDatabaseReady()` method
   - Enhanced `createPostgreSQLDatabase()` with readiness waiting
   - Updated `createSandbox()` to accept database credentials parameter
   - Improved error handling throughout

2. **`/app/api/sandbox/[projectId]/route.ts`**
   - Modified database creation flow to pass credentials directly
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Eliminated race condition between database and sandbox creation

3. **Test Files Created:**
   - `/lib/test-aaa-sandbox.ts` - Complete end-to-end test
   - Verified all existing tests still pass

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing projects with databases continue to work unchanged
- ✅ Projects without databases get automatic database creation
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms ensure no breaking changes
- ✅ All existing test cases continue to pass

## Performance Impact

- **Database Creation**: +2 minutes max (for waiting for cluster readiness)
- **Sandbox Creation**: Significantly faster (no credential lookup delays)
- **Overall**: Better user experience with proper progress indication

This fix resolves the fundamental timing issue and makes the database integration robust and reliable for all projects.
