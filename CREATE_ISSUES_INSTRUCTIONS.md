# How to Create GitHub Issues for v0.1.0 Todo List

I've created a script that will automatically create all 6 GitHub issues for the v0.1.0 todo list items.

## Method 1: Using the Automated Script (Recommended)

### Step 1: Get a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Issue Creator")
4. Select scope: `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Important:** Copy the token immediately as you won't be able to see it again

### Step 2: Run the Script

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/fanux/Desktop/aicoding/FullstackAgent

# Run the script with your token
./create-issues.sh YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` with the actual token you copied.

### Step 3: Verify Issues Created

The script will output the URLs of all created issues. Visit each to verify they were created correctly.

## Method 2: Manual Creation (Alternative)

If you prefer to create issues manually, use the content from `iteration/v0.1.0-issues.md`:

1. Go to https://github.com/FullstackAgent/FullstackAgent/issues/new
2. Copy the title and body from each issue template
3. Add appropriate labels: `enhancement`, `v0.1.0`, and specific tags

## Issues That Will Be Created

1. **Network Configuration** - Support port creation and CNAME configuration
2. **Claude Code Environment Variables** - Default support in Sandbox
3. **Auth Configuration** - Ensure effectiveness in sandbox
4. **Payment Configuration** - Stripe and PayPal integration
5. **GitHub Association** - Project binding functionality
6. **Deployment Functionality** - Automated deployment via GitHub Actions

## Troubleshooting

### Script fails with "401 Unauthorized"
- Your GitHub token may be expired or invalid
- Ensure the token has `repo` scope
- Generate a new token if needed

### Script fails with "403 Forbidden"
- Your token may not have sufficient permissions
- Ensure you have write access to the repository
- Contact repository admin if needed

### Network issues
- Check your internet connection
- Try running the script again
- GitHub API may be temporarily unavailable

## After Creating Issues

Once all issues are created:
1. They will be automatically tagged with `v0.1.0` label
2. Each issue will have appropriate labels for the feature area
3. You can assign issues to team members as needed
4. Issues can be linked to your project management board

## Next Steps

- Review each created issue for accuracy
- Assign priorities and milestones
- Link issues to any relevant project management tools
- Start working on the issues based on your development priorities
