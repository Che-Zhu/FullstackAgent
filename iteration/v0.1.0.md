# Todo List

* Network configuration - support creating new ports and CNAME configuration
* Default support for Claude Code related environment variables, ensure default environment variables are effective in Sandbox, display sensitive environment variables in secrets
* Ensure Auth Configuration settings are effective in the sandbox environment
* Payment configuration parameters should be consistent with Stripe and PayPal, ensure effectiveness after configuration
* Implement GitHub project association functionality, UI can be modified, no need for users to input Repository Name, support binding to existing GitHub repositories
* Deployment functionality - prerequisite is GitHub association, directly use GitHub mirror repository, automatically generate actions in sandbox to trigger builds, deploy to Sealos (using current kubeconfig)
